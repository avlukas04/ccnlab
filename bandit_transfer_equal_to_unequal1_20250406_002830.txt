COMPLETE PROMPT SENT TO MODELS:
==================================================

You are an AI agent using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a Two-Armed Bandit task. Your goal is to maximize total reward by balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action).

Below is the Python implementation of the Two-Armed Bandit model that follows Q-learning:


class TwoArmedBandit:
    def __init__(self, epsilon=0.1, alpha=0.5):
        self.num_arms = 2  # Only two possible actions
        self.q_values = np.zeros(2)  # Two Q-values
        self.epsilon = epsilon  # Exploration probability
        self.alpha = alpha  # Learning rate

    def select_action(self):
        """Choose an action using epsilon-greedy strategy."""
        if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
            return np.random.choice(self.num_arms)  # Explore
        return np.argmax(self.q_values)  # Exploit

    def update_q_values(self, action, reward):
        """Update Q-values using the RL update formula."""
        self.q_values[action] += self.alpha * (reward - self.q_values[action])


You have been learning in Training Environment with the following trial history:

Trial 1:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 1
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.5), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False
Trial 2:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 1
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.75), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False
Trial 3:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 1
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.875), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False
Trial 4:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 0
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.438), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False

You are now placed in a new environment with different reward probabilities.
Your current Q-values from the training environment are: [np.float64(0.438), np.float64(0.0)]

For each of the next 4 trials in this new environment, simulate the cognitive model's decision-making process step by step:

Trial 1:
1. Current Q-values: [np.float64(0.438), np.float64(0.0)]
2. Using epsilon=0.1, would this be an exploration or exploitation trial? (Show your probability calculation)
3. Based on the above, which arm would you choose?
4. Assuming you receive a reward of 1, show how the Q-values would update
5. Assuming you receive a reward of 0, show how the Q-values would update

Trial 2:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 1 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
3. Explain your arm choice
4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

Trial 3:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 2 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
3. Explain your arm choice
4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

Trial 4:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 3 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
3. Explain your arm choice
4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

For each trial, structure your response as:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision (with probability calculation)
2. Arm Choice (with explanation)
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: [show calculation]
   - If reward = 0: [show calculation]

Remember:
- You keep your initial Q-values from training: [np.float64(0.438), np.float64(0.0)]
- Use epsilon-greedy with epsilon=0.1
- Learning rate alpha=0.5
- Show all calculations explicitly

==================================================
Model: gpt-4
Description: Most capable GPT-4 model
Status: success
Tokens Used: {'prompt_tokens': 884, 'completion_tokens': 764, 'total_tokens': 1648}
Response: Trial 1:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision: np.random.rand gives us a uniform distribution [0,1], if this value is less than 0.1(epsilon), we explore, otherwise we exploit. Let's assume np.random.rand returned 0.05 (< 0.1), so we perform exploration.
2. Arm Choice: During exploration we choose one of the arms at random. Let's assume we chose Arm 2 (action index 1)
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: Q[1] = 0 + 0.5 * (1 - 0) = 0.5; New Q-values would be [0.438, 0.5]
   - If reward = 0: Q[1] = 0 + 0.5 * (0 - 0) = 0; New Q-values remain the same [0.438, 0]

Trial 2:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision: Assume np.random.rand returned 0.15 (> 0.1), we perform exploitation.
2. Arm Choice: During exploitation we choose the arm with the highest Q-value. From Trial 1, we assume the reward was 1, so our current Q-values are [0.438, 0.5], therefore, we'd choose Arm 2.
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: Q[1] = 0.5 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.75; New Q-values would be [0.438, 0.75]
   - If reward = 0: Q[1] = 0.5 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.5) = 0.25; New Q-values would be [0.438, 0.25]

Trial 3:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision: Assume np.random.rand returned 0.07 (< 0.1), we perform exploration.
2. Arm Choice: During exploration we choose one of the arms at random. Let's assume we chose Arm 1 (action index 0)
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: Q[0] = 0.438 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.438) = 0.719; New Q-values would be [0.719, 0.75]
   - If reward = 0: Q[0] = 0.438 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.438) = 0.219; New Q-values would be [0.219, 0.75]

Trial 4:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision: Assume np.random.rand returned 0.2 (> 0.1), we perform exploitation.
2. Arm Choice: During exploitation we choose the arm with the highest Q-value. From Trial 3, we assume the reward was 1, so our current Q-values are [0.719, 0.75], therefore, we'd choose Arm 2.
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: Q[1] = 0.75 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.875; New Q-values would be [0.719, 0.875]
   - If reward = 0: Q[1] = 0.75 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.75) = 0.375; New Q-values would be [0.719, 0.375]

Model: gpt-4-turbo-preview
Description: Latest GPT-4 model, faster and cheaper than standard GPT-4
Status: success
Tokens Used: {'prompt_tokens': 884, 'completion_tokens': 933, 'total_tokens': 1817}
Response: Let's simulate the decision-making process for the next 4 trials.

### Trial 1:

1. **Exploration/Exploitation Decision**
   - Since the probability of exploration is 0.1, it means there's a 10% chance the model will explore and a 90% chance it will exploit.
   - Using a hypothetical random number generation, if `np.random.rand()` generates a number < 0.1, it would explore; otherwise, it exploits.

2. **Arm Choice**
   - Assuming it exploits (because the likelihood of exploitation is higher at 90%), it would choose the arm with the highest Q-value.
   - Current Q-values: [0.438, 0.0], so it would choose arm 0.
   
3. **Q-value Updates:**
   - Learning rate, alpha = 0.5.
   
   If reward = 1:
   - Q_values[0] = 0.438 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.438) = 0.438 + 0.281 = 0.719
   
   If reward = 0:
   - Q_values[0] = 0.438 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.438) = 0.438 - 0.219 = 0.219

### Trial 2:

Assuming the outcome of Trial 1 was a reward = 1 (to continue the calculations), the new Q-values will be: [0.719, 0.0].

1. **Exploration/Exploitation Decision**
   - Using the same process as before, we check for exploration or exploitation.

2. **Arm Choice**
   - Still likely to exploit, it would again choose arm 0 given its higher Q-value [0.719, 0.0].
   
3. **Q-value Updates:**
   - If reward = 1:
      - Q_values[0] = 0.719 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.719) = 0.719 + 0.141 = 0.860
      
   - If reward = 0:
      - Q_values[0] = 0.719 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.719) = 0.719 - 0.360 = 0.359

### Trial 3:

Assuming reward = 1 in Trial 2, the Q-values become [0.860, 0.0].

1. **Exploration/Exploitation Decision**
   - Continuation of the previous approach, still deciding between exploring and exploiting.

2. **Arm Choice**
   - Likely to continue with exploitation, opting for arm 0 [0.860, 0.0].
   
3. **Q-value Updates:**
   - If reward = 1:
     - Q_values[0] = 0.860 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.860) = 0.860 + 0.070 = 0.930
     
   - If reward = 0:
      - Q_values[0] = 0.860 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.860) = 0.860 - 0.430 = 0.430

### Trial 4:

Let's assume reward = 1 again for Trial 3; new Q-values are [0.930, 0.0].

1. **Exploration/Exploitation Decision**
   - Following the trend of the decision-making process, using epsilon-greedy strategy.
   
2. **Arm Choice**
   - With a high likelihood of exploiting, the system chooses arm 0 [0.930, 0.0].
   
3. **Q-value Updates:**
   - If reward = 1:
     - Q_values[0] = 0.930 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.930) = 0.930 + 0.035 = 0.965
     
   - If reward = 0:
     - Q_values[0] = 0.930 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.930) = 0.930 - 0.465 = 0.465

This step-by-step process illustrates how reinforcement learning updates Q-values based on the rewards received, optimizing towards selecting the action that maximizes future rewards, while allowing for a set probability of exploration to potentially discover better long-term strategies.

2. Arm Choice:
   Since it's an exploration trial, we choose a random arm.
   Randomly chosen arm = 1

3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1:
     New Q-value for chosen arm = 0.734 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.734) = 0.867
