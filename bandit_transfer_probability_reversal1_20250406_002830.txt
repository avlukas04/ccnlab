COMPLETE PROMPT SENT TO MODELS:
==================================================

You are an AI agent using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a Two-Armed Bandit task. Your goal is to maximize total reward by balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action).

Below is the Python implementation of the Two-Armed Bandit model that follows Q-learning:


class TwoArmedBandit:
    def __init__(self, epsilon=0.1, alpha=0.5):
        self.num_arms = 2  # Only two possible actions
        self.q_values = np.zeros(2)  # Two Q-values
        self.epsilon = epsilon  # Exploration probability
        self.alpha = alpha  # Learning rate

    def select_action(self):
        """Choose an action using epsilon-greedy strategy."""
        if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
            return np.random.choice(self.num_arms)  # Explore
        return np.argmax(self.q_values)  # Exploit

    def update_q_values(self, action, reward):
        """Update Q-values using the RL update formula."""
        self.q_values[action] += self.alpha * (reward - self.q_values[action])


You have been learning in Training Environment with the following trial history:

Trial 1:
- Chosen Arm: 2
- Reward: 0
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.0), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: True
Trial 2:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 0
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.0), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False
Trial 3:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 1
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.5), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False
Trial 4:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 0
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.25), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False

You are now placed in a new environment with different reward probabilities.
Your current Q-values from the training environment are: [np.float64(0.25), np.float64(0.0)]

For each of the next 4 trials in this new environment, simulate the cognitive model's decision-making process step by step:

Trial 1:
1. Current Q-values: [np.float64(0.25), np.float64(0.0)]
2. Using epsilon=0.1, would this be an exploration or exploitation trial? (Show your probability calculation)
3. Based on the above, which arm would you choose?
4. Assuming you receive a reward of 1, show how the Q-values would update
5. Assuming you receive a reward of 0, show how the Q-values would update

Trial 2:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 1 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
3. Explain your arm choice
4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

Trial 3:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 2 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
3. Explain your arm choice
4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

Trial 4:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 3 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
3. Explain your arm choice
4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

For each trial, structure your response as:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision (with probability calculation)
2. Arm Choice (with explanation)
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: [show calculation]
   - If reward = 0: [show calculation]

Remember:
- You keep your initial Q-values from training: [np.float64(0.25), np.float64(0.0)]
- Use epsilon-greedy with epsilon=0.1
- Learning rate alpha=0.5
- Show all calculations explicitly

Model: gpt-4
Description: Most capable GPT-4 model
Status: success
Tokens Used: {'prompt_tokens': 884, 'completion_tokens': 842, 'total_tokens': 1726}
Response: Trial 1:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision:
   - Generate a random number r between 0 and 1 (r~U[0,1])
   - If r < epsilon=0.1, it's an exploration decision.
   - If r ≥ 0.1, it's an exploitation decision. 
2. Assuming r ≥ 0.1, we choose Arm 1 (indexing starting from 1), as its Q-value 0.25 is higher than that of Arm 2.
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: Q_values[1] = Q_values[1] + alpha*(reward - Q_values[1]) = 0.25 + 0.5*(1 - 0.25) = 0.625
   - If reward = 0: Q_values[1] = Q_values[1] + alpha*(reward - Q_values[1]) = 0.25 + 0.5*(0 - 0.25) = 0.125

Trial 2:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision (with r generated as above).
2. Assuming we received reward of 1 and r ≥ 0.1 in the previous trial: our Q-values are [np.float64(0.625), np.float64(0.0)], and we choose Arm 1 again.
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: Q_values[1] = Q_values[1] + alpha*(reward - Q_values[1]) = 0.625 + 0.5*(1 - 0.625) = 0.8125
   - If reward = 0: Q_values[1] = Q_values[1] + alpha*(reward - Q_values[1]) = 0.625 + 0.5*(0 - 0.625) = 0.3125
   
Trial 3:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision (with r generated as above).
2. Assuming we received reward of 1 and r ≥ 0.1 in the previous trial: our Q-values are [np.float64(0.8125), np.float64(0.0)], and we choose Arm 1 again.
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: Q_values[1] = Q_values[1] + alpha*(reward - Q_values[1]) = 0.8125 + 0.5*(1 - 0.8125) = 0.90625
   - If reward = 0: Q_values[1] = Q_values[1] + alpha*(reward - Q_values[1]) = 0.8125 + 0.5*(0 - 0.8125) = 0.40625


Trial 4:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision (with r generated as above).
2. Assuming we received reward of 1 and r >= 0.1 in the previous trial: our Q-values are [np.float64(0.90625), np.float64(0.0)], and we choose Arm 1 again.
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: Q_values[1] = Q_values[1] + alpha*(reward - Q_values[1]) = 0.90625 + 0.5*(1 - 0.90625) = 0.953125
   - If reward = 0: Q_values[1] = Q_values[1] + alpha*(reward - Q_values[1]) = 0.90625 + 0.5*(0 - 0.90625) = 0.453125

Note: The above simulations assume that the exploitation decision is made in every trial. If r < 0.1 in any trial, a random arm would be chosen for exploration. The primary premise behind these calculations is of maximizing the total future reward (exploring less as we learn more about the environment).

Model: gpt-4-turbo-preview
Description: Latest GPT-4 model, faster and cheaper than standard GPT-4
Status: success
Tokens Used: {'prompt_tokens': 884, 'completion_tokens': 1016, 'total_tokens': 1900}
Response: ### Trial 1:

1. **Exploration/Exploitation Decision:**
   Since epsilon=0.1, there is a 10% chance of exploration and a 90% chance of exploitation.
   
2. **Arm Choice:**
   If we are exploiting, we choose the arm with the highest Q-value, which is arm 1 (Q-value = 0.25) because it is higher than arm 2 (Q-value = 0.0).
   
3. **Q-value Updates:**
   - If reward = 1:
     - Arm 1: New Q-value = 0.25 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.25) = 0.25 + 0.375 = 0.625
     - Arm 2: No update since it wasn't chosen.
   - If reward = 0:
     - Arm 1: New Q-value = 0.25 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.25) = 0.25 - 0.125 = 0.125
     - Arm 2: No update since it wasn't chosen.

### Trial 2 (Assuming reward = 1 was received in Trial 1):

1. **Exploration/Exploitation Decision:**
   Still a 10% chance of exploration and 90% chance of exploitation.
   
2. **Arm Choice:**
   New Q-values are [0.625, 0.0]. Exploiting would again choose arm 1 since it has the higher Q-value.
   
3. **Q-value Updates:**
   - If reward = 1:
     - Arm 1: New Q-value = 0.625 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.625) = 0.625 + 0.1875 = 0.8125
     - Arm 2: No update.
   - If reward = 0:
     - Arm 1: New Q-value = 0.625 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.625) = 0.625 - 0.3125 = 0.3125
     - Arm 2: No update.

### Trial 3 (Assuming continued reward = 1, Q-values from Trial 2: [0.8125, 0.0]):

1. **Exploration/Exploitation Decision:**
   The same exploration vs exploitation logic applies, with a 10% chance for exploration.
   
2. **Arm Choice:**
   Exploiting, which means choosing arm 1 again due to its higher Q-value (0.8125) over arm 2 (0.0).
   
3. **Q-value Updates:**
   - If reward = 1:
     - Arm 1: New Q-value = 0.8125 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.8125) = 0.8125 + 0.09375 = 0.90625
     - Arm 2: No update.
   - If reward = 0:
     - Arm 1: New Q-value = 0.8125 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.8125) = 0.8125 - 0.40625 = 0.40625
     - Arm 2: No update.

### Trial 4 (Assuming continued reward = 1, Q-values from Trial 3: [0.90625, 0.0]):

1. **Exploration/Exploitation Decision:**
   With a consistent approach, there’s still a 10% chance to explore and 90% to exploit.
   
2. **Arm Choice:**
   We would choose arm 1 again for exploitation due to its superior Q-value (0.90625) over arm 2 (0.0).
   
3. **Q-value Updates:**
   - If reward = 1:
     - Arm 1: New Q-value = 0.90625 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.90625) = 0.90625 + 0.046875 = 0.953125
     - Arm 2: No update.
   - If reward = 0:
     - Arm 1: New Q-value = 0.90625 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.90625) = 0.90625 - 0.453125 = 0.453125
     - Arm 2: No update.

This breakdown shows the adaptation of Q-values across trials based on both the decision strategy (epsilon-greedy) and the possible outcomes of each trial's reward. The Q-value updates follow the pattern of increasing significantly with rewards and decreasing with the absence of rewards, underlining the essence of reinforcement learning's adaptive nature.

Response: Trial 1:
1. Current Q-values: [np.float64(0.25), np.float64(0.0)]
2. Using epsilon=0.1, would this be an exploration or exploitation trial? (Show your probability calculation)
   Since np.random.rand() = 0.07, which is less than epsilon=0.1, this trial is an exploration trial with a probability of 0.1.
3. Based on the above, which arm would you choose?
   Since this is an exploration trial, we randomly choose an arm. Let's choose Arm 1.
4. Assuming you receive a reward of 1, show how the Q-values would update
   The Q-value update formula is: Q(a) = Q(a) + alpha * (reward - Q(a))
   Q(1) = 0.25 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.25) = 0.625
   Q(0) remains 0
   Therefore, the updated Q-values would be: [np.float64(0.625), np.float64(0.0)]
5. Assuming you receive a reward of 0, show how the Q-values would update
   Q(1) = 0.625 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.625) = 0.3125
   Q(0) remains 0

Trial 2:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 1 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
   Current Q-values: [np.float64(0.3125), np.float64(0.0)]
   Since np.random.rand() = 0.17, which is less than epsilon=0.1, this trial is an exploration trial with a probability of 0.1.
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
   This trial is an exploration trial with a probability of 0.1.
3. Explain your arm choice
   Since this is an exploration trial, we randomly choose an arm. Let's choose Arm 0.

   Assuming reward = 1:
   Q(0) = 0.3125 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.3125) = 0.65625
   Q(1) remains 0

   Assuming reward = 0:
   Q(0) = 0.3125 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.3125) = 0.15625
   Q(1) remains 0
   Therefore, the potential Q-values would be: [np.float64(0.65625), np.float64(0.0)]

Trial 3:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 2 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
   Current Q-values: [np.float64(0.65625), np.float64(0.0)]
   Since np.random.rand() = 0.66, which is greater than epsilon=0.1, this trial is an exploitation trial.
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
   This trial is an exploitation trial.
3. Explain your arm choice
   Since this is an exploitation trial, we choose the arm with the highest Q-value. Let's choose Arm 0.
4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

   Q(0) = 0.65625 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.65625) = 0.328125
   Q(1) remains 0
   Therefore, the potential Q-values would be: [np.float64(0.828125), np.float64(0.0)]

Trial 4:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 3 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
   Current Q-values: [np.float64(0.828125), np.float64(0.0)]
   Since np.random.rand() = 0.73, which is greater than epsilon=0.1, this trial is an exploitation trial.
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
   This trial is an exploitation trial.
3. Explain your arm choice
   Since this is an exploitation trial, we choose the arm with the highest Q-value. Let's choose Arm 0.
