COMPLETE PROMPT SENT TO MODELS:
==================================================

You are an AI agent using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a Two-Armed Bandit task. Your goal is to maximize total reward by balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action).

Below is the Python implementation of the Two-Armed Bandit model that follows Q-learning:


class TwoArmedBandit:
    def __init__(self, epsilon=0.1, alpha=0.5):
        self.num_arms = 2  # Only two possible actions
        self.q_values = np.zeros(2)  # Two Q-values
        self.epsilon = epsilon  # Exploration probability
        self.alpha = alpha  # Learning rate

    def select_action(self):
        """Choose an action using epsilon-greedy strategy."""
        if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
            return np.random.choice(self.num_arms)  # Explore
        return np.argmax(self.q_values)  # Exploit

    def update_q_values(self, action, reward):
        """Update Q-values using the RL update formula."""
        self.q_values[action] += self.alpha * (reward - self.q_values[action])


You have been learning in Training Environment with the following trial history:

Trial 1:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 1
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.5), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False
Trial 2:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 0
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.25), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False
Trial 3:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 1
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.625), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False
Trial 4:
- Chosen Arm: 1
- Reward: 1
- Q-values: [np.float64(0.812), np.float64(0.0)]
- Exploration: False

You are now placed in a new environment with different reward probabilities.
Your current Q-values from the training environment are: [np.float64(0.812), np.float64(0.0)]

For each of the next 4 trials in this new environment, simulate the cognitive model's decision-making process step by step:

Trial 1:
1. Current Q-values: [np.float64(0.812), np.float64(0.0)]
2. Using epsilon=0.1, would this be an exploration or exploitation trial? (Show your probability calculation)
3. Based on the above, which arm would you choose?
4. Assuming you receive a reward of 1, show how the Q-values would update
5. Assuming you receive a reward of 0, show how the Q-values would update

Trial 2:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 1 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
3. Explain your arm choice
4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

Trial 3:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 2 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
3. Explain your arm choice
4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

Trial 4:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 3 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision
2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation
3. Explain your arm choice
4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

For each trial, structure your response as:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision (with probability calculation)
2. Arm Choice (with explanation)
3. Q-value Updates:
   - If reward = 1: [show calculation]
   - If reward = 0: [show calculation]

Remember:
- You keep your initial Q-values from training: [np.float64(0.812), np.float64(0.0)]
- Use epsilon-greedy with epsilon=0.1
- Learning rate alpha=0.5
- Show all calculations explicitly

Model: gpt-4
Description: Most capable GPT-4 model
Status: success
Tokens Used: {'prompt_tokens': 884, 'completion_tokens': 980, 'total_tokens': 1864}
Response: Here is the cognitive model's decision-making process for the four trials using the initial Q-values from the training phase [np.float64(0.812), np.float64(0.0)]:

TRIAL 1:
---------------
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision: 
With an epsilon of 0.1, there is a 90% chance of exploitation and a 10% chance of exploration. Assume that we randomly generate 0.2. This is higher than epsilon, hence result is exploitation.

2. Arm Choice:
With exploitation, the arm with the highest Q-value is chosen, which is arm 0.

3. Q-value Updates:
    - If reward = 1: 
    Q-value of arm 0 is updated as: Q(0) + alpha * (reward - Q(0)) = 0.812 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.812) = 0.906
    - If reward = 0: 
    Q-value of arm 0 is updated as: Q(0) + alpha * (reward - Q(0)) = 0.812 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.812) = 0.406

TRIAL 2:
---------------
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision: 
With an epsilon of 0.1, there is a 90% chance of exploitation and a 10% chance of exploration. Assume that we randomly generate 0.05. This is less than epsilon, hence result is exploration.

2. Arm Choice:
With exploration, we randomly select an arm. Assume we randomly select arm 1.

3. Q-value Updates:
    - If reward = 1: 
    Q-value of arm 1 is updated as: Q(1) + alpha * (reward - Q(1)) = 0.0 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.0) = 0.5
    - If reward = 0: 
    Q-value of arm 1 is updated as: Q(1) + alpha * (reward - Q(1)) = 0.0 + 0.5 * (0.0 - 0.0) = 0.0

TRIAL 3:
---------------
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision: 
With an epsilon of 0.1, there is a 90% chance of exploitation and a 10% chance of exploration. Assume that we randomly generate 0.9. This is higher than epsilon, hence result is exploitation.

2. Arm Choice:
With exploitation, the arm with the highest Q-value is chosen. Let's assume that after the previous trial, arm 0 still has the highest Q-value and thus is selected (0.906).

3. Q-value Updates:
    - If reward = 1: 
    Q-value of arm 0 is updated as: Q(0) + alpha * (reward - Q(0)) = 0.906 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.906) = 0.953
    - If reward = 0: 
    Q-value of arm 0 is updated as: Q(0) + alpha * (reward - Q(0)) = 0.906 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.906) = 0.453

TRIAL 4:
---------------
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision: 
With an epsilon of 0.1, there is a 90% chance of exploitation and a 10% chance of exploration. Assume that we randomly generate 0.3. This is higher than epsilon, hence result is exploitation.

2. Arm Choice:
With exploitation, the arm with the highest Q-value is chosen, which is still arm 0 (0.953).

3. Q-value Updates:
    - If reward = 1: 
    Q-value of arm 0 is updated as: Q(0) + alpha * (reward - Q(0)) = 0.953 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.953) = 0.9765
    - If reward = 0: 
    Q-value of arm 0 is updated as: Q(0) + alpha * (reward - Q(0)) = 0.953 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.953) = 0.4765

Note: All the probabilities generated are hypothetical and used for the sake of explaining the simulation process, it may be different while actually running the code. Also, Q value updates depends upon the immediate reward received which in this case have been considered for both extreme values of reward, i.e., 0 or 1.

Model: gpt-4-turbo-preview
Description: Latest GPT-4 model, faster and cheaper than standard GPT-4
Status: success
Tokens Used: {'prompt_tokens': 884, 'completion_tokens': 1106, 'total_tokens': 1990}
Response: Let's go through the decision-making process step by step for each of the four trials in the new environment, based on the provided Python implementation and settings (epsilon=0.1, alpha=0.5).

### Trial 1

#### 1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision
- There's a 10% chance (`epsilon=0.1`) for exploration and a 90% chance for exploitation.

#### 2. Arm Choice
- **Assuming Exploration**: Randomly choose between arm 0 or 1.
- **Assuming Exploitation**: Choose the arm with the highest Q-value which is arm 0 (Q-values = [0.812, 0.0]).

#### 3. Q-value Updates:
- **Reward = 1:**
    - If arm 0 is chosen: \(Q_{new}(0) = Q_{old}(0) + \alpha \times (R - Q_{old}(0)) = 0.812 + 0.5 \times (1 - 0.812) = 0.906\)
    - If arm 1 is chosen, \(Q_{new}(1) = Q_{old}(1) + \alpha \times (R - Q_{old}(1)) = 0.0 + 0.5 \times (1 - 0.0) = 0.5\)

- **Reward = 0:**
    - If arm 0 is chosen: \(Q_{new}(0) = Q_{old}(0) + \alpha \times (R - Q_{old}(0)) = 0.812 + 0.5 \times (0 - 0.812) = 0.406\)
    - If arm 1 is chosen, \(Q_{new}(1) = Q_{old}(1) + \alpha \times (R - Q_{old}(1)) = 0.0 + 0.5 \times (0 - 0.0) = 0.0\)

For the sake of continuity in this scenario, let's assume the chosen arm is based on exploitation, and the reward was 1. Therefore, we proceed with updated Q-values of [0.906, 0.0] for Trial 2.

### Trial 2

#### 1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision
- Again, 10% exploration chance and 90% exploitation chance.

#### 2. Arm Choice
- With updated Q-values [0.906, 0.0], exploitation would lead to choosing arm 0 again.

#### 3. Q-value Updates:
- **Reward = 1:**
    - \(Q_{new}(0) = 0.906 + 0.5 \times (1 - 0.906) = 0.953\)
    - For arm 1, not applicable as it wouldn't be chosen under exploitation.

- **Reward = 0:**
    - \(Q_{new}(0) = 0.906 + 0.5 \times (0 - 0.906) = 0.453\)
    - For arm 1, still not applicable as it wouldn't be chosen.

Assuming the pattern follows with rewards of 1, Q-values are now [0.953, 0.0].

### Trial 3

#### 1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision
- Continues with 10% exploration and 90% exploitation.

#### 2. Arm Choice
- Updated Q-values are [0.953, 0.0]. Exploitation leads to arm 0.

#### 3. Q-value Updates:
- **Reward = 1:**
    - \(Q_{new}(0) = 0.953 + 0.5 \times (1 - 0.953) = 0.9765\)
    - Arm 1 not chosen.

- **Reward = 0:**
    - \(Q_{new}(0) = 0.953 + 0.5 \times (0 - 0.953) = 0.4765\)
    - Arm 1 not chosen.

With rewards continuing at 1, the updated Q-values become [0.9765, 0.0].

### Trial 4

#### 1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision
- Still 10% exploration vs. 90% exploitation.

#### 2. Arm Choice
- With Q-values [0.9765, 0.0], arm 0 will be chosen again.

#### 3. Q-value Updates:
- **Reward = 1:**
    - \(Q_{new}(0) = 0.9765 + 0.5 \times (1 - 0.9765) = 0.98825\)

- **Reward = 0:**
    - \(Q_{new}(0) = 0.9765 + 0.5 \times (0 - 0.9765) = 0.48825\)

By consistently choosing the arm with the highest Q-value and updating based on the received reward, the agent uses the epsilon-greedy method to balance between exploration and exploitation, gradually increasing its preference for the arm with the highest expected value based on past experiences.

Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Description: Fast and cost-effective model
Status: success
Tokens Used: {'prompt_tokens': 884, 'completion_tokens': 678, 'total_tokens': 1562}
Response: Trial 1:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision:
   - Since epsilon=0.1, we explore 10% of the time. To decide whether to explore or exploit, we generate a random number between 0 and 1. If this number is less than epsilon, we explore. If not, we exploit.
   - Calculation: Random number = np.random.rand() = 0.3 > 0.1 epsilon
   - Decision: Exploitation (90% chance)

2. Arm Choice:
   - We exploit by choosing the arm with the highest Q-value, which is arm 1 with Q-value 0.812.

3. Q-value Updates:
   - Reward = 1: Q-value update formula - Q(a) = Q(a) + alpha * (reward - Q(a))
     - Updated Q-values:
       - Q(arm 0) = 0.812 (remains the same)
       - Q(arm 1) = 0.812 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.812) = 0.906

4. Potential Q-value update for reward=0:
   - Reward = 0: Q-value update formula - Q(a) = Q(a) + alpha * (reward - Q(a))
     - Updated Q-values:
       - Q(arm 0) = 0.812 (remains the same)
       - Q(arm 1) = 0.812 (remains the same)

Trial 2:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision:
   - Using Q-values from Trial 1, assume reward=1. We exploit by choosing the arm with the highest Q-value. Since our Q-values are [0.812, 0.906], we exploit.

2. Arm Choice:
   - We exploit and select arm 1 with the higher Q-value of 0.906.

3. Q-value Updates for Trial 2:
   - Reward = 1: No update needed
   - Reward = 0: No update needed

Trial 3:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision:
   - Using Q-values from Trial 2, assume reward=1. We exploit by choosing the arm with the highest Q-value, [0.812, 0.906].

2. Arm Choice:
   - We exploit and select arm 1 with the higher Q-value of 0.906.

3. Q-value Updates for Trial 3:
   - Reward = 1: No update needed
   - Reward = 0: No update needed

Trial 4:
1. Exploration/Exploitation Decision:
   - Using Q-values from Trial 3, assume reward=1. We exploit by choosing the arm with the highest Q-value, [0.812, 0.906].

2. Arm Choice:
   - We exploit and select arm 1 with the higher Q-value of 0.906.

3. Q-value Updates for Trial 4:
   - Reward = 1: No update needed
   - Reward = 0: No update needed
 
By following the epsilon-greedy strategy and considering the Q-value updates, the AI agent consistently chooses arm 1, which yields a higher reward among the two arms in the new environment.

Model: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
Description: GPT-3.5 with longer context window
Status: success
Tokens Used: {'prompt_tokens': 884, 'completion_tokens': 1668, 'total_tokens': 2552}
Response: Trial 1:
1. Current Q-values: [np.float64(0.812), np.float64(0.0)]

2. Using epsilon=0.1, would this be an exploration or exploitation trial?

The exploration probability is given by epsilon=0.1, which means there is a 10% chance of exploration. To determine if this trial is an exploration or exploitation trial, we compare a randomly generated number between 0 and 1 with epsilon. If the generated number is less than epsilon, it is an exploration trial; otherwise, it is an exploitation trial.

Random number generated: 0.4
Epsilon value: 0.1

Since the randomly generated number (0.4) is greater than epsilon (0.1), this trial is an exploitation trial.

3. Based on the above, which arm would you choose?

In an exploitation trial, we choose the arm with the highest Q-value. In this case, the Q-values are [0.812, 0.0], and the arm with the highest Q-value is arm 1.

Arm choice: 1

4. Assuming you receive a reward of 1, show how the Q-values would update

The Q-value update formula is given by:
Q(a) = Q(a) + α * (reward - Q(a))

For an exploitation trial, the chosen arm's Q-value is updated using the above formula.

Current Q-values: [0.812, 0.0]
Reward: 1
Learning rate (α): 0.5

Q-value update for arm 1:
Q(1) = 0.812 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.812) = 0.812 + 0.5 * 0.188 = 0.812 + 0.094 = 0.906

Q-value update equation:
Q(1) = 0.906
Q(0) remains unchanged: 0.0

Updated Q-values: [0.906, 0.0]

5. Assuming you receive a reward of 0, show how the Q-values would update

Current Q-values: [0.812, 0.0]
Reward: 0
Learning rate (α): 0.5

Q-value update for arm 1:
Q(1) = 0.812 + 0.5 * (0 - 0.812) = 0.812 + 0.5 * -0.812 = 0.812 - 0.406 = 0.406

Q-value update equation:
Q(1) = 0.406
Q(0) remains unchanged: 0.0

Updated Q-values: [0.406, 0.0]

Trial 2:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 1 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision

Current Q-values: [0.906, 0.0]
Reward from Trial 1: 1

2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation

The exploration probability is given by epsilon=0.1, which means there is a 10% chance of exploration. We compare a randomly generated number between 0 and 1 with epsilon to determine if this trial is an exploration or exploitation trial.

Random number generated: 0.6
Epsilon value: 0.1

Since the randomly generated number (0.6) is greater than epsilon (0.1), this trial is an exploitation trial.

3. Explain your arm choice

In an exploitation trial, we choose the arm with the highest Q-value. In this case, the Q-values are [0.906, 0.0], and the arm with the highest Q-value is arm 0.

Arm choice: 0

4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

Current Q-values: [0.906, 0.0]

Assuming reward = 1:

Q-value update for arm 0:
Q(0) = 0.906 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.906) = 0.906 + 0.5 * 0.094 = 0.906 + 0.047 = 0.953

Q-value update equation:
Q(0) = 0.953
Q(1) remains unchanged: 0.0

Updated Q-values: [0.953, 0.0]

Assuming reward = 0 (no change in Q-values since Q(0) remains unchanged from Trial 1).

Trial 3:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 2 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision

Current Q-values: [0.953, 0.0]
Reward from Trial 2: 1

2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation

The exploration probability is given by epsilon=0.1, which means there is a 10% chance of exploration. We compare a randomly generated number between 0 and 1 with epsilon to determine if this trial is an exploration or exploitation trial.

Random number generated: 0.8
Epsilon value: 0.1

Since the randomly generated number (0.8) is greater than epsilon (0.1), this trial is an exploitation trial.

3. Explain your arm choice

In an exploitation trial, we choose the arm with the highest Q-value. In this case, the Q-values are [0.953, 0.0], and the arm with the highest Q-value is arm 0.

Arm choice: 0

4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

Current Q-values: [0.953, 0.0]

Assuming reward = 1:

Q-value update for arm 0:
Q(0) = 0.953 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.953) = 0.953 + 0.5 * 0.047 = 0.953 + 0.024 = 0.977

Q-value update equation:
Q(0) = 0.977
Q(1) remains unchanged: 0.0

Updated Q-values: [0.977, 0.0]

Assuming reward = 0 (no change in Q-values since Q(0) remains unchanged from Trial 2).

Trial 4:
1. Using the Q-values from Trial 3 (assume you got reward=1), make your next decision

Current Q-values: [0.977, 0.0]
Reward from Trial 3: 1

2. Show the exploration vs exploitation calculation

The exploration probability is given by epsilon=0.1, which means there is a 10% chance of exploration. We compare a randomly generated number between 0 and 1 with epsilon to determine if this trial is an exploration or exploitation trial.

Random number generated: 0.3
Epsilon value: 0.1

Since the randomly generated number (0.3) is less than epsilon (0.1), this trial is an exploration trial.

3. Explain your arm choice

In an exploration trial, we randomly choose one of the arms with equal probability. In this case, we choose arm 1.

Arm choice: 1

4. Show potential Q-value updates for both reward outcomes

Current Q-values: [0.977, 0.0]

Assuming reward = 1:

Q-value update for arm 1:
Q(1) = 0.0 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.0) = 0.0 + 0.5 * 1 = 0.0 + 0.5 = 0.5

Q-value update equation:
Q(1) = 0.5
Q(0) remains unchanged: 0.977

Updated Q-values: [0.977, 0.5]

Assuming reward = 0 (no change in Q-values since Q(0) remains unchanged from Trial 3).
